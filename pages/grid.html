                <p class="grid-2 poem">I had to have something to lift me from the garbage of my days.
                    The Arab has his hashish, the soldier his danger,
                    the codger his childhood, children their tears, the rich
                    their gold, visits, masquerades; the poor
                    have their hunger and children, merchants their losses,
                    and wives their vegetables and chatter. It all
                    drifts up to me where I sit, like burning garbage,
                    the cries, laughter, wagons, animals, ashes.</p>
                <p class="grid-2 poem">The old, as I said, have their childhood. Up from the gnarled
                    ailing feet, the ropy veins, the long
                    slack scrotum, the fallen belly, the breasts
                    like paper lanterns hung too long in the weather;
                    up from the bedpans and hernias, the hacking, hawking,
                    rotten, or false, or no, teeth, rheumy
                    eyes, from yellowy hair, rises the faint
                    odorless dream of what they were; or what
                    they were not, who can be sure? They remember childhood
                    as a monk remembers women: something attainable,
                    had or not had, what matter? in another life,
                    by the man one could have been, if one had not
                    been saddled from the very beginning with being oneself</p>    
                <p class="grid-2 poem">So I remember Simeon, my brother.
                    I turn to his image as to a glimmer of childhood,
                    or a photograph of some naked untouchable woman.
                    As if, out of this scrabbling, screaming, screwing,
                    eating, sweating, I might drift up to him,
                    incinerated, white, weightless, nothing.
                    Is it strange such rotten flesh as his should seem
                    a haven from my own decay? His garbage
                    is not my garbage; his wound, remembered,
                    is clean as chiselled stone, his fetor rises
                    metaphysical as wind, his handkerchief</p>
